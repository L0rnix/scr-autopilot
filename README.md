# SCR-Autopilot
Hello,
MaTY-MT/SCR-Autopilot is archived, and I have a couple reasons why:
- I haven't been enjoying the development, the last commit was like last year
- The development of this has been pretty difficult and tedious
- I don't really enjoy playing SCR anymore

This is sadly bad news for some people, but also good news for some.
If you really want to still have the autopilot functionality in SCR, different projects have now appeared, so maybe give them a try! :)
